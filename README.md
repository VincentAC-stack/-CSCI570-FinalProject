# Summary
From the result and graph, we can see that as increasing problem size(m * n), the line of DP's memory is linear(y = k * m * n), and the line of the DP&DC's memory is almost close to x-axis. In result, the complexity of DP's memory is O(m * n), but the complexity of DP&DC's memory is O(m + n). In the Time Graph, the time complexity of DP and DP&DC are both O(m * n). However, the line of DP&DC is steeper than DP which means DP&DC uses more time than DP.
