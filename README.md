# -CSCI570-FinalProject
This is the Final Project which was a part of the coursework for CSCI-570 Analysis of Algorithms. It was aimed at Sequence Alignment using the basic Dynamic Programming approach and a space-efficient (linear space instead of quadratic) version of the same algorithm known as the Hirschberg Algorithm.
